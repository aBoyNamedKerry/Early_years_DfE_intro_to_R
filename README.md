# Early_years_DfE_intro_to_R
A short markdown presentation designed to get colleagues in Early years familiar with R and to be able to run R code. This refers to the Early years analysis and research unit at the Department for Education.

The contents are largely based on the material previously prepared by the Data Science Team at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
